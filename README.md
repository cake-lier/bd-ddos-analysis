# bd-ddos-analysis
The repository for the Big Data course project based on analysis of DDoS Attacks.

## Queries plan

### Flow Analysis

  - [X] Percentage of DDoS attacks over the total number of flows
  - [ ] Find out from which country the attacks originated the most
  - [ ] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of DDoS attacks flow temporal duration for a "benign" flow
  - [ ] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of DDoS attacks flow temporal duration for a "DDoS" flow
  - [ ] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of DDoS attacks bytes/s for a "benign" flow
  - [ ] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of DDoS attacks bytes/s for a "DDoS" flow
  - [ ] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of DDoS attacks packets/s for a "benign" flow
  - [ ] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of DDoS attacks packets/s for a "DDoS" flow
  - [X] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of number of packets belonging to a "benign" flow
  - [X] Min, Max, Mean and Std Dev of number of packets belonging to a "DDoS" flow

### Packet Analysis

  - [X] The most "Well-Known" ports attacked by DDoS attacks
  - [X] The most used network layer protocol vectoring a DDoS attacks

### Metrics evaluation
  - [ ] Check the number of true-positive, false-negatives, true-negatives, false-positive.
